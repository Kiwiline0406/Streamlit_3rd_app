# Streamlit_3rd_app

This is about to create our third app as a Wild Code School's Challenge with those criteria : 
- an authentication page allowing access to the home page and the photo album of a (your ?) cat (or any other animal of your choice)
- the cat's pictures are placed to be stacked by 3 on the same line
- the account's datas are provided by a csv file, read with pandas in Streamlit. The file should contains the following columns : name, password, email, failed_login_attemps, logged_in et role.
- the navbar shoul be placed in th sidebar. It will also include : 'DÃ©connexion' and a welcome message such as 'Bienvenue Username'.

And then, the app will be deployed on Streamlit.io 

The app is there : https://wcs-third-app.streamlit.app/
